So You Want To Contribute?
==========================

Fantastic! Thats great news. Here is the skinny on how to contribute to this project.

Make Your Own Repo
------------------

Clearly, you're probably familiar with making your own repo with this same
source code. Go ahead and do that. Make your changes. Test them to make sure
they work! We absolutely will not accept anything that doesn't pass muster.
Wondering what will pass muster? Here are a few things we will look for:

Is it PEP8?
-----------

Clearly, this nitpicky, but it is a requirement. So please, follow PEP8 to the closest you possibly can. We can
fix minor items that don't abide by PEP8, but please make it close.

Does it pass the tests?
-----------------------

Any merge that will be accepted *absolutely must* pass the following tests::

    git pull <your repo> your-repo
    cd ncpa-branch-pull
    git checkout <your dev branch>
    python run_tests.py agent/ client/

If it does not pass this, we will not merge the pull request. So please, run
these tests before submitting your pull request!

Is the change intelligible?
---------------------------

Does the change you pushed make sense? WE LOVE code that is functional, and we
will definitely work with pull requests that are functional but might be
questionable in implementation. So please, even if you feel your change is
a one-off or not proper, submit it for review! We want the code to be proper and
maintainable just as you. We will work with any change that is movement towards
something that makes the software fit the needs of the user better.

Making Sure Your Changes Merge
------------------------------

Since you took the time to change the code, its going to be a lot easier for you
to ensure the code merges properly.  Otherwise, someone who isn't familiar with
your changes might make the changes and be caught in an awkward situation.
We'll just assume your repo is called *<your repo>* and you're done all work on
your *development* branch.  Please run the following, and if a merge conflict
pops up, note it in the pull request::

    cd <your ncpa repo>
    git checkout development
    python run_tests.py agent/ client/ # This better pass!
    git add remote upstream https://github.com/NagiosEnterprises/ncpa
    git merge upstream/development
